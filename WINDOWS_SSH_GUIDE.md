# ü™ü Windows SSH Guide for AWS EC2

## How to SSH into your AWS EC2 instance from Windows

Since you're on Windows, you have several options for SSH. Here's the easiest approach:

## üéØ Option 1: Using Windows PowerShell (Recommended)

### **Step 1: Open PowerShell**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `powershell` and press Enter
3. Or search "PowerShell" in Start menu

### **Step 2: Navigate to your key file**
```powershell
# Go to your Downloads folder (where the .pem file was downloaded)
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads

# List files to confirm your key is there
ls *.pem
```

### **Step 3: Set key file permissions (Windows equivalent)**
```powershell
# Remove inheritance and set permissions for current user only
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):R"
```

### **Step 4: SSH into your EC2 instance**
```powershell
# Replace YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP with your actual EC2 public IP
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@51.21.253.140
```

**Example:**
```powershell
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@3.15.123.456
```

## üéØ Option 2: Using Git Bash (If you have Git installed)

### **Step 1: Open Git Bash**
1. Right-click in your Downloads folder

3. Or open Git Bash from Start menu and navigate to Downloads

### **Step 2: Set permissions and SSH**
```bash

chmod 400 tourlicity-key.pem

# SSH into your instance
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP
```

## üéØ Option 3: Using PuTTY (Traditional Windows SSH client)

### **Step 1: Download PuTTY**
1. Go to [putty.org](https://www.putty.org/)

3. Select your `tourlicity-key.pem` file
4. Click **"Save private key"**
5. Save as `tourlicity-key.ppk`

### **Step 3: Connect with PuTTY**
1. Open **PuTTY**
2. **Host Name**: `ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP`
3. **Port**: `22`
4. **Connection Type**: `SSH`
5. Go to **Connection ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí Auth**
6. **Private key file**: Browse and select `tourlicity-key.ppk`

## üîç Finding Your EC2 Public IP

### **In AWS Console:**
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard**
2. Click **"Instances"** in left sidebar
3. Select your instance
4. Look for **"Public IPv4 address"** in the details below
5. Copy this IP address

**Example IP formats:**
- `3.15.123.456`
- `18.191.45.123`
- `52.14.78.234`

## üöÄ Complete Step-by-Step Example

### **Using PowerShell (Most Common):**

```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell
# Press Windows + R, type "powershell", press Enter

# 2. Go to Downloads folder
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads

# 3. Check if your key file is there
ls tourlicity-key.pem

# 4. Set permissions (Windows way)
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):R"

# 5. SSH into your EC2 instance (replace with your actual IP)
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@3.15.123.456
```

### **What you'll see when it works:**
```
The authenticity of host '3.15.123.456 (3.15.123.456)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '3.15.123.456' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-1040-aws x86_64)

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **"Permission denied (publickey)" error:**
```powershell
# Make sure you're using the right username (ubuntu for Ubuntu AMI)
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-IP

# NOT ec2-user, NOT root, NOT admin - use "ubuntu"
```

### **"Bad permissions" error:**
```powershell
# Fix permissions again
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "tourlicity-key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):R"
```

### **"Connection timed out" error:**
- Check your Security Group has SSH (port 22) rule
- Verify you're using the correct public IP
- Make sure your EC2 instance is running

### **"Host key verification failed" error:**
```powershell
# Remove old host key and try again
ssh-keygen -R YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-EC2-PUBLIC-IP
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Save SSH command for easy reuse:**
Create a text file with your SSH command:
```
ssh -i tourlicity-key.pem ubuntu@3.15.123.456
```
Save it as `connect-to-aws.txt` for easy copy-paste.

### **Keep PowerShell window open:**
Don't close the PowerShell window while connected to your server.

### **Multiple sessions:**
You can open multiple PowerShell windows to have multiple SSH connections.

**You're now ready to connect to your AWS EC2 instance!** üöÄ
