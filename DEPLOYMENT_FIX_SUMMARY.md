# üéâ Tourlicity Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: `tourlicity.duckdns.org` was showing "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Docker Compose Syntax Error**: The nginx service was defined outside the services block
2. **Build Dependencies Missing**: The Dockerfile lacked build dependencies for the canvas package
3. **Nginx Container Not Running**: Due to the syntax error, nginx wasn't starting properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Docker Compose Structure ‚úÖ
- Moved nginx service definition inside the services block
- Fixed volumes and networks placement
- Ensured proper service dependencies

### 2. Updated Build Configuration ‚úÖ
- Changed from `Dockerfile` to `Dockerfile.production`
- Added all necessary build dependencies for canvas:
  - python3, make, g++
  - cairo-dev, jpeg-dev, pango-dev
  - And other graphics libraries

### 3. Successful Deployment ‚úÖ
- All containers now running properly:
  - ‚úÖ tourlicity-api (healthy)
  - ‚úÖ tourlicity-mongodb (healthy) 
  - ‚úÖ tourlicity-redis (healthy)
  - ‚úÖ tourlicity-nginx (running on port 80)
