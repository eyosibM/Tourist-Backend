# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive email and password-based authentication system for the backend API. The system will provide secure user registration, login, password reset functionality, and email verification to ensure user account security and authenticity.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The backend service responsible for managing user authentication, registration, and account security
- **User_Account**: A registered user profile containing email, password, and verification status
- **Email_Verification**: The process of confirming user email ownership through verification tokens
- **Password_Reset**: The secure process of allowing users to change forgotten passwords
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token used for maintaining user session state
- **Verification_Token**: Unique token sent via email for account verification or password reset
- **Email_Service**: Service responsible for sending verification and password reset emails

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with my email and password, so that I can create an account and access the platform

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data with valid email and password, THE Authentication_System SHALL create a new User_Account with unverified status
2. WHEN a user submits registration data with an already registered email, THE Authentication_System SHALL return an error indicating email is already in use
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL hash and securely store the user password using bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds
4. WHEN a User_Account is created, THE Authentication_System SHALL generate a Verification_Token and send verification email
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate email format and password strength before account creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and use the platform

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid email and password credentials, THE Authentication_System SHALL return a JWT_Token for authenticated access
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials, THE Authentication_System SHALL return an authentication error without revealing which field is incorrect
3. WHEN an unverified user attempts to sign in, THE Authentication_System SHALL return an error indicating email verification is required
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login attempts
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL log successful and failed authentication attempts for security monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email, so that I can regain access to my account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset with a registered email, THE Authentication_System SHALL generate a secure reset token and send reset email
2. WHEN a user requests password reset with an unregistered email, THE Authentication_System SHALL not reveal whether the email exists in the system
3. WHEN a user submits a valid reset token with new password, THE Authentication_System SHALL update the password and invalidate the reset token
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL expire password reset tokens after 1 hour for security
5. WHEN a password is successfully reset, THE Authentication_System SHALL invalidate all existing JWT_Tokens for that user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to verify my email address, so that I can confirm my account ownership and enable full account access

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a verification link with valid token, THE Authentication_System SHALL mark the User_Account as verified
2. WHEN a user submits an expired or invalid verification token, THE Authentication_System SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL expire email verification tokens after 24 hours
4. WHEN a user requests a new verification email, THE Authentication_System SHALL generate a new token and invalidate previous ones
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL allow users to resend verification emails with rate limiting to prevent spam

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be secure and maintainable, so that user data is protected and the system is reliable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL implement proper input validation and sanitization for all authentication endpoints
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL use secure HTTP headers and implement CORS policies for API security
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide comprehensive error handling without exposing sensitive system information
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL integrate with existing middleware for consistent API behavior
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain audit logs for all authentication-related activities
