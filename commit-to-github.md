# Commands to Run After Creating GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Verify remote is set correctly
```bash
git remote -v
```

## Step 2: Add any new files and commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Tourlicity API with enterprise features and data model analysis"
```

## Step 3: Push to the new repository
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## If you get authentication errors, you might need to:
1. Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Or configure SSH keys

## Alternative: If the repository already has content
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## To verify the push was successful
```bash
git log --oneline -3
```
